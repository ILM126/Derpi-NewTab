# Derpibooru New Tab Page for Google Chrome #

This is a small and simplistic new tab page replacement for Google Chrome, which uses the latest wallpapers from [Derpibooru.org](http://derpibooru.org/).

## Setup ##

To install the extension, first clone the repository to your disk, then visit `chrome://extensions` in Chrome. There will be a check mark on the top left side of the page labeled "Developer mode". Tick it, then click "Load unpacked extension...". You will be presented with a folder selector, select the "derpinewtab" folder inside the cloned repository folder, and confirm your selection. If you are asked if you really want to install this extension, accept it.

## Notes ##

Since the extension is installed in Developer Mode, the browser will display a warning on Windows systems upon every start up. There is no way to disable it, as this is done by design to avoid malicious applications from installing extensions without the user's consent, but it's more of an annoyance than anything else.

## Why don't you just upload it to the CWS? ##

Since I don't have a credit card I cannot upload anything to the Chrome Web Store because of the developer fee, so I had to find alternate ways to distribute the extension. Not like it would get too much attention anyway.
